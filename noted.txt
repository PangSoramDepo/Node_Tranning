***DTO (Data Transfer Object) 2-13: 
_is an object that carries data between processes.
_is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network.
_DTO can define using interface or class (recommend use classes)
-->DTO is not a model definition. If define the shape of data for a specific case, for exmaple - creating a task.
-->Sometime people use DTO to define the Model : this is wrong...
 
*** NestJS can not refer to interface in run-time, but can refer to classes
